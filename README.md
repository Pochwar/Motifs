# Motifs

Motifs is a project originally made by Gautier Sire with [Processing](https://processing.org/)

The point was to rewrite this project with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) to learn this library and to enjoy generating patterns :D

## Usage

Just clone/download the repository and open `index.html` in yout browser.

#### Info

P5 dependencies are included in this project as P5.gui is not included in p5 npm package

todo : replace p5.gui by p5.dom in order to use p5 as an NPM dependency.
